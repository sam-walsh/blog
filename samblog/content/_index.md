Hey there, I'm Sam. I grew up in Oakland, CA and I recently graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a combined B.A. in Math/Economics. I'm a big baseball fan, which I love to play and watch. I also like working with data and using it to generate insights with methods such as visualization, simulation, or machine learning. 

When I'm not writing python or deep into baseball analytics I enjoy reading, watching movies, weight lifting, backpacking, and playing video games.
